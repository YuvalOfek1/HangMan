# HangMan

In this mini-game project, I created a Hang-Man.
In the beginning - there is a short intro that explains the rules of the game, then the game begins.

The program fetches a random word from a bank of words (words.txt) and then draws the guillotine depending on how many lives are left.
You will get the numbers of the word's letters by underlines. Any mistake will result in loss of life, a "miss" sound, and will draw one of the man's body parts.

If only 1 life is left - you will hear an alert sound and warning line, but if you mistake in this one, the game is over and you'll be asked if you want to play again. 

Enjoy!
